# Collection-of-Tools  
I developed some visualization tools for analyzing password data sets.  
Project Structures:

tool_file.py Functions that store some file operations.  
tool_plot.py A function that plots data.  

Tool1:  
tool_character.py Analyze the frequency of each character in the file content, and draw pictures in descending order of frequency.

1.If you want to use it, please import tool_file.py and tool_plot.py.  
2.The result is shown in figure
